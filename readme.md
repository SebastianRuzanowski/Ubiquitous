# 1. Introduction

## 1.1. Functionalities
- ***Notification management*** 
    - Channels
        * [x] SignalR (WebSocket)
        * [ ] Push notification (Toastr)
        * [ ] E-mail
    - Types
        * [x] product published
        * [x] product added
        * [x] product properties changed
    - Operations
        * [ ] auto-confirmation
        * [ ] hide notification
        * [ ] remove notification
        * [ ] silence type of notification
-  ***Notifications persistency*** 
    * [x] each notification and subscribers state are persisted in PostgreSQL
    * [x] welcome notifications are sent from last 24hrs for first log-in
- ***admin management (next versions)*** 
    - Operations 
        * [ ] manage products and its details thru product service API
        * [ ] manage users subscriptions
        * [ ] manage subscribers notifications

## 1.2 Purpose
- **prime goal** is/was an education and giving my best around programming topics like 
     - .NET Core
     - Microservices
     - Docker
     - DDD
     - Angular
     - ...
     - and so much more
- Secondly **most of repositories** I have visited were
    - Relatively small, no possibility to run into issues of performance
    - Easy concerns or well known domain (orders, eShop)
    - Unfinished
    
## 1.3 Install

####1.3.0. Prerequisites

    - Docker
    - Docker composer
    
####1.3.1. Run 
```cmd
docker-compose -f docker-compose-infrastructure.yml up
```
####1.3.2. Enter localhost:5450 (PGAdmin) and run
```postgresql
CREATE DATABASE product-service;
CREATE DATABASE smartstore-adapter;
CREATE DATABASE fetch-service;
CREATE DATABASE notification-service;
```

####1.3.3. Replace value from file '.env' and row 'RELATIVEPATH' to your relative path indicating folder containing folders with appsettings or adjust them to your preferenes.

####1.3.4. Run 

```cmd
docker-compose -f docker-compose-services.yml up
```

####1.3.5. You can manage all containers from portainer dashboard.

## 2. Server Side Architecture
Whole solution is designed and broken down to
   - **Frontend** is (being) implemented  in **Angular 7** with **Angular Material** as UI component infrastructure and Material Design components.
   - **Backend** is (being) written in **.NET Core 2.2**(current stable version). 

Down below, a services dependency diagram. See to #3.1 for listed used technologies, tools and their use.

</p>

### 2.1 Technologies And Tools
- ***EF Core 2.2*** *(ORM)*
- ***RabbitMQ*** *(Service-service communication)*
- ***Consul*** *(Service discovery, keep alive)*
- ***Fabio*** *(Load balancer)*
- ***MediatR*** *(CQRS pattern dispatch)*
- ***Docker*** *(Containers environment)*
- ***Polly*** *(Resiliency policies)*
- ***Serilog*** *(Logging)*
- ***AutoMapper*** *(Objects mappings)*
- ***PostgreSql*** *(Database)*
- ***Gitlab DevOps*** *(CI)*
- ***SignalR*** *(Asynchronous communication, Notifications)*
- ***Redis*** Distributed caching & SignalR backplane

- ***Ocelot*** [todo] API Gateway
- ***Jaeger*** [todo] Tracing
- ***Grafana*** [todo] Metrics
- ***Prometheus*** [todo] Metrics infrastructure

### 2.2 Services
-------
**Services**
- ***SmartStore Adapter*** Wholesale, source of data
- ***Fetch Service*** Fetches data from wholesales(many) and pushes newest items on bus
- ***Product Service*** Main domain aggregate service, handles products and its business logic
- ***Report Service*** Handles reports and its generation thanks to [Caracan](https://github.com/caracan-team)
- ***Notification Service*** Handles notifications and channels it by WebSocket
-------
### 2.3 Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Modules**
- ***IntegrationEvent Log*** 
    - Persistent Module with shared Unit Of Work logic for integration events for UDP-like communication
- ***EventBus RabbitMQ*** 
    - RabbitMQ asynchronous queue shared logic of subscription and publishing
- ***Common*** 
    - Shared logic
        - Tracing (Jaeger)
        - Logging (Serilog)
        - Service Discovery (Consul)
        - Load Balancing (Fabio)
        - Resiliency (Polly)
        - Pagination
